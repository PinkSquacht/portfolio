          <p>
            I’m Lloyd Bowar, a certified full-stack developer and IT consultant
            based in the U.S. With hands-on experience at Leviton
            in technical support, I specialize in building modern, scalable web
            applications and helping individuals and small businesses solve
            real-world tech challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expertise spans React, Node.js, Python, SQL, and more. I’m passionate
            about making technology accessible, whether it’s through step-by-step
            guides, security best practices, or custom software solutions. I thrive
            on problem-solving, continuous learning, and collaborating with others
            to deliver results that matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of tech, I’m a proud parent of a son and daughter, and engaged
            to my wonderful fiancé. I enjoy gaming, fishing, and watching movies—
            activities that keep me inspired and balanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not coding, I enjoy consulting for local businesses, exploring
            new tech trends, and sharing my knowledge to empower others. I’m
            available for freelance projects, consulting, and collaboration—let’s
            build something great together!
